# Custom_agent_LLM

This notebook walks through how to create your own custom agent.

An agent consists of four parts:

    Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.
    The agent class itself: this decides which action to take.
    Multiple agent interaction where companyagent use the information collected by main agent to answer an query.
    Agent can connect with database to answer or summarize the text or user queries

In this notebook I walk through how to create a custom agent that predicts/takes multiple steps at a time.
